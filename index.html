    <h2>House Caesar Salad</h2>
	<p> Start by washing the romaine lettuce thoroughly under cold water and patting it dry, then tear or chop the leaves into bite-sized pieces. Prepare the dressing, either from scratch by mixing garlic, lemon juice, Dijon mustard, olive oil, and grated Parmesan cheese, or use a store-bought Caesar dressing. Place the lettuce in a large bowl and toss it with the dressing until all the leaves are evenly coated. Add croutons and extra Parmesan on top, and optionally finish with freshly cracked black pepper or a squeeze of lemon. Serve immediately while the lettuce is crisp and fresh.</p>
    <h2>Hand Cut Fries</h2>
	<p> Start by washing and peeling the potatoes, then cut them into even sticks or wedges. Rinse the cut potatoes under cold water to remove excess starch, then pat them completely dry with a towel. Toss the potato pieces with olive oil, salt, and any optional seasonings like black pepper, paprika, or fresh herbs. Spread them evenly on a baking sheet or prepare them for frying in hot oil until they are golden brown and crispy. Once cooked, remove them from heat and let them cool slightly before serving, enjoying them fresh and warm alongside your meal.</p>
    <h2>Pink Rosé Wine</h2>
	<p> Enjoy a refreshing glass of pink Rosé wine of your choice to complete your meal. Its sweetness balances the savory flavors perfectly </p>
